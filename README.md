1. Unzip MDP.zip to get working grids
2. run "java-jar rl_sim.jar" to start the gui
4. load big and small samples into the policy iteration
5. initialize then execute to run the algorithms on the MDPs created
Repeat for value iteration, q-learning algorithms

All credit for graphs and grids created go to the creators for the reinforcement learning gui, taken from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/
